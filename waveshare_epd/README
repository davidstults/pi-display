The files here come directly from the waveshare web site, here: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.7inch_e-Paper_HAT

AFAIK they are completely public and we are not violating anything by including them here.  These are unmodified.

These two files are the minimum required to write to the display using Python.  I elected not to include the entire package from waveshare.
